### What is this?

I created this framework to make my mods more modular and fully self-contained. This way, they have no hard dependencies and can be used standalone, but also work when installed together with my other mods.
Basically each mod consist of individual components, and if multiple mods are present that contain the same component, only the newer version of that component is loaded.
In addition, the framework also contains some common code that is used by all my mods.

If you have any questions or would like to use the framework for your own mods, you can contact me on Discord: m00nl1ght#6339
